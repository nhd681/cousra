<h1 align="left">'Internet</h1>
<p1>Internet grew out of a research network originally funded by U.S. Department of Defense. This 
network is the ARPAnet after the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), began in 1969. 
As the network grew, it was used for applications beyond research, such as electronic mail. 
In the early 1980s, the current versions of the core Internet protocols, TCP and IP, were 
<introduced across the network. The term Internet comes from the word “inter-network” - an 
interconnected set of networks. In 1992, the Center for European Nuclear Research (CERN)
released the first versions of World Wide Web software. Subsequently, the number of Web 
servers has grown quickly.</p1>
<h2 align="left">WWW</h2>
<p2>WWW stands for World Wide Web, and it is an advanced information retrieval system. In 
March, 1989, Tim Berners Lee of European Particle Physics Laboratory (CERN) circulated a 
proposal to develop a hypertext system for global information sharing in High Energy Physics 
community.The World Wide Web project began to take shape at the beginning of 1991. In October 1991, the 
gateway for WAIS search (a crucial development for the Web’s future as search as well as a 
browsing tool) was developed. Before the end of 1991, CERN announced the Web to the High 
Energy Physics community in general. 1992 was a developmental year for WWW. In March of 
1993, WWW traffic clocked in at 0.1 percent of total Internet backbone traffic. In July of 1994, 
CERN began to turn over the Web project to a new group called the W3 organization, a joint 
venture between CERN and MIT to develop the Web further.</p2>

<p3>Many people consider Internet and WWW as synonyms. Internet the backbone network which 
offers a lot of services. WWW is just one of the services offered by the Internet!
